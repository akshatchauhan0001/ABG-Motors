### Market Entry Analysis for ABG Motors in India

This project was developed as part of the Data Science training course on Internshala. The primary goal is to assist ABG Motors, a Japanese automotive company, in determining whether it should enter the Indian market. By analyzing datasets from both Japanese and Indian markets, the project aims to model and predict potential car purchases in India based on insights from the Japanese market.

Project Description

ABG Motors is considering expanding its operations into India. Given the similarity between the Japanese and Indian automotive markets, this project involves:

Data Analysis: Leveraging datasets from both markets to understand purchase behaviors.
Model Development: Creating a predictive model using the Japanese dataset to forecast car purchases in the Indian market.
Decision Making: Providing a recommendation on whether ABG Motors should enter the Indian market based on the predicted results.
